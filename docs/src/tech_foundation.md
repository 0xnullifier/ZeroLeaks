# Technical Foundation

ZeroLeaks is built upon a foundation of cutting-edge technologies that work together to create a secure, private, and verifiable whistleblowing platform. This section provides an overview of the key technologies and how they integrate to form our solution.

## Core Technology Stack

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

Zero-knowledge proofs form the cryptographic backbone of ZeroLeaks, enabling users to prove the authenticity of documents without revealing sensitive information about themselves or the documents' contents.

**Key Benefits:**

- Prove email authenticity without revealing sender/receiver details
- Verify document integrity without exposing content
- Maintain complete anonymity while establishing credibility

### 2. Sui Blockchain

The Sui blockchain serves as our immutable ledger for storing proofs, managing the DAO, and handling token transactions.

**Why Sui:**

- High throughput and low latency for real-time verification
- Object-centric programming model ideal for our use case
- Strong developer ecosystem and tooling
- Native support for complex smart contract interactions

### 3. Walrus Decentralized Storage

Walrus provides decentralized, censorship-resistant storage for encrypted documents.

**Advantages:**

- No single point of failure
- Built-in redundancy and availability guarantees
- Integration with Sui ecosystem
- Cost-effective storage for large documents

### 4. Seal Encryption

Mysten Labs' Seal protocol handles end-to-end encryption of sensitive documents.

**Features:**

- Threshold encryption with recovery mechanisms
- Integration with blockchain infrastructure
- Secure key management
- Forward secrecy

## Architecture Integration

These technologies work together in a carefully orchestrated system:

1. **Submission Phase**: Users generate zero-knowledge proofs of email authenticity
2. **Storage Phase**: Documents are encrypted with Seal and stored on Walrus
3. **Verification Phase**: Proofs are verified and recorded on Sui blockchain
4. **Governance Phase**: DAO members vote on document access using blockchain-based governance

## Security Guarantees

The combination of these technologies provides:

- **Anonymity**: Zero-knowledge proofs hide user identity
- **Integrity**: Blockchain ensures data cannot be tampered with
- **Availability**: Decentralized storage prevents censorship
- **Confidentiality**: End-to-end encryption protects document contents
- **Verifiability**: Anyone can independently verify claims on the blockchain

## Scalability Considerations

Our architecture is designed to scale:

- Sui's parallel execution model handles high transaction volumes
- Walrus distributes storage load across multiple nodes
- Zero-knowledge proofs can be generated client-side
- Caching strategies reduce blockchain queries for frequently accessed data

This foundation enables ZeroLeaks to operate as a trustless, decentralized platform that protects whistleblowers while ensuring the integrity of leaked information.
