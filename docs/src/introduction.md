# Introduction

## What is ZeroLeaks?

ZeroLeaks is a revolutionary whistleblowing platform that combines cutting-edge cryptographic technologies with blockchain infrastructure to create a secure, anonymous, and verifiable system for sharing sensitive information. Built on the Sui blockchain and leveraging zero-knowledge proofs, ZeroLeaks addresses the critical need for protecting whistleblowers while ensuring the authenticity of leaked documents.

## The Problem We Solve

Traditional whistleblowing faces several critical challenges:

- **Source Protection**: Whistleblowers risk retaliation, prosecution, or worse when their identities are exposed
- **Document Authenticity**: Recipients cannot verify if leaked documents are genuine without potentially compromising the source
- **Centralized Vulnerabilities**: Traditional platforms create single points of failure and censorship
- **Trust Issues**: No transparent mechanism to verify the credibility of leaks

## Our Solution

ZeroLeaks provides a comprehensive solution through:

### Zero-Knowledge Email Verification

Using advanced cryptographic circuits, sources can prove they received legitimate emails from specific domains without revealing their identity or the full email content. This creates verifiable proof of authenticity while maintaining complete anonymity.

### Decentralized Storage

Documents are encrypted using Mysten Labs' Seal encryption protocol and stored on Walrus, ensuring they cannot be censored or tampered with while remaining accessible to authorized parties.

### Blockchain Verification

All proofs and verifications are permanently recorded on the Sui blockchain, creating an immutable audit trail that anyone can verify independently.

### DAO Governance

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governs access to sensitive documents, ensuring democratic decision-making about what information should be made public.

## Key Features

- **Anonymous Submission**: Submit leaks without revealing your identity
- **Cryptographic Proof**: Zero-knowledge proofs verify document authenticity
- **Decentralized Storage**: Documents stored securely on Walrus with Seal encryption
